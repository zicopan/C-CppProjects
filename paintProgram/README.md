# C-CppProjects
OpenGL and GLUT are used to create a paint program where the user can draw freely in multiple colours. Aside from freely drawing by clicking and dragging, the program uses Bresenham's algorithm to draw straight lines between two clicked points, rectangles between two clicks specifying the verticies, and circles with two clicks specifying center and radius. 

User can also change the brush size by typing "-" to decrease or "=" to increase. By right clicking, there is a menu which has submenus for colour/shape customization, as well as an option to clear the screen.

See paintPic for an example.
